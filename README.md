 # Large-scale Deep Learning with High-Performance Comptuing for Earth Observation

This repository hosts the support material of the „*Large-Scale Deep Learning with HPC for Earth Observation*“ mini-course offered by the University of Iceland as part of the 2025 [Blended Intensive Program](https://internazionale.unipv.eu/it/machine-learning-for-earth-observation-and-data-fusion/) online segment.

Check the full programme here 👉 [https://go.fzj.de/bip-ml-for-eo-and-data-fusion](https://go.fzj.de/bip-ml-for-eo-and-data-fusion)


## Content

The mini-course consits of 
- an introduction lecture by [Prof. Dr. -Ing. Gabriele Cavallaro](https://www.gabriele-cavallaro.com/)
- two guided hands-on tutorials
- a facilitated self-learning session
